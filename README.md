Try Try Try

After struggling with a getting the example running for snooze-rs
https://github.com/gekkio/snooze-rs

I found my trouble centered around try!, and my total lack of understanding

So I am going to try and learn myself something.

---

So this is mostly working through https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/
and we will see what comes out.

I am very excited as ruby programming, learning about

  * map return results
  * and_then
  * or_else

These all seem immediately useful, I think it might be useful
to rewrite some common ruby situations that could benefit from
these language features, or really just this pattern.

As this could be implemented in Ruby.

---

So now this is turning into an exploration, of common
patterns seen in Rails controllers, and how to use
Rust's Results to various language features to better express
what we would like in Ruby.
